# projecteuler
Collection of my solutions for problems found on [projecteuler](https://projecteuler.net).

According to the about page on the project I strongly encourage everyone not to spoil themselves by looking at my solutions!

All my solutions are written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and can be run by executing `cargo run --release --bin problem_xxxx` where xxxx is to be replaced with the problem number (padded with zeros if needed).

Aside from some exceptions all problems should be solved reasonably fast (<1 second).
Some problem executables however contain benchmarks, increasing their runtime.
